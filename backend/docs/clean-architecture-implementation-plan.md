## Benefits of Clean Architecture

The clean architecture refactoring provides several benefits to the application:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Business logic is isolated from data access and presentation logic
2. **Testability**: Services and repositories can be easily mocked for unit testing
3. **Maintainability**: Common operations are centralized and reusable
4. **Type Safety**: TypeScript types ensure correct data structures
5. **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling across all operations
6. **Dependency Injection**: Flexible dependency management
7. **Scalability**: Easy to add new features and services
8. **Documentation**: Clear architecture makes it easier to document and understand

## Conclusion

The clean architecture refactoring is a significant undertaking that will improve the maintainability, testability, and scalability of the application. The work completed so far has established a solid foundation for the refactoring process, and the next steps will build on this foundation to create a robust, maintainable, and scalable application.
