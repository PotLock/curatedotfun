  # No database service needed as we're using SQLite
  # We can add other services here if needed in the future
  # For example, Redis when it's implemented
  
  # Example for future Redis implementation:
  # redis:
  #   image: redis:alpine
  #   ports:
  #     - '63790:6379'
  #   command: redis-server --appendonly yes
