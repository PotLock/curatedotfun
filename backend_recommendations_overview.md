# Backend Refactoring & Improvement Recommendations

This document outlines key recommendations for refactoring and improving the `curatedotfun` backend, based on the architecture analysis. The primary goals are to move all configurations to the database, implement robust role-based access control (RBAC), and enhance code consistency and maintainability.

## Recommendation Categories:

1.  **[Configuration Management & Database Migration](./config_migration_recommendations.md)**:
    *   Details on migrating `AppConfig` (global settings, plugin registry) to the database.
    *   Schema design for new configuration tables.
    *   Refactoring `ConfigService` to use database-backed configurations.
    *   Strategies for seeding, dynamic updates, and caching of configurations.

2.  **[Security & Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](./rbac_recommendations.md)**:
    *   Designing database schemas for users, roles, and permissions.
    *   Implementing RBAC for accessing and modifying configurations and other sensitive operations.
    *   Integrating RBAC with the existing authentication middleware.

3.  **[Code Consolidation, Cleanup, and Standardization](./code_cleanup_recommendations.md)**:
    *   Standardizing service and repository access patterns.
    *   Refining dependency injection via `ServiceProvider`.
    *   Addressing potential redundancies (e.g., leaderboard logic).
    *   Improving consistency in error handling and environment variable management.
    *   Clarifying lifecycle management for services with background tasks.

## General Approach:

It's recommended to tackle these changes iteratively:

1.  **Strengthen Core Services & DI**: Begin with refactoring `ServiceProvider` and ensuring consistent dependency injection for existing services and repositories. This forms a stable base. (Covered in `code_cleanup_recommendations.md`)
2.  **Database-Driven Configuration**: Migrate global and plugin configurations to the database. This is a foundational step for dynamic and secure configuration management. (Covered in `config_migration_recommendations.md`)
3.  **Implement RBAC**: Once configurations are in the database, implement the RBAC layer to control access to them. (Covered in `rbac_recommendations.md`)
4.  **Iterative Refinements**: Address other code cleanup, redundancy, and standardization points.

This phased approach will make the refactoring process more manageable and allow for testing at each stage.
