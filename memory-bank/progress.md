# Progress Tracking

## Refactoring Roadmap Progress

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure & Type System
- [ ] Create `backend/src/core/types.ts` for centralized type definitions
- [ ] Implement `backend/src/core/errors.ts` for custom error classes
- [ ] Set up dependency injection container in `backend/src/core/container.ts`
- [ ] Define application context in `backend/src/core/appContext.ts`
- [ ] Create validation middleware using Zod

### Phase 2: Data Access Layer
- [ ] Create `backend/src/services/db/repositories/base.repository.ts`
- [ ] Refactor SubmissionRepository to extend BaseRepository
- [ ] Refactor FeedRepository to extend BaseRepository
- [ ] Refactor LeaderboardRepository to extend BaseRepository
- [ ] Refactor TwitterRepository to extend BaseRepository
- [ ] Move query logic from queries.ts into respective repositories
- [ ] Standardize error handling in repositories
- [ ] Add missing repository methods for complete data access

### Phase 3: Service Layer
- [ ] Define standard service interfaces
- [ ] Refactor ConfigService to use constructor injection
- [ ] Refactor DistributionService to use constructor injection
- [ ] Refactor PluginService to use constructor injection
- [ ] Refactor ProcessorService to use constructor injection
- [ ] Refactor SchedulerService to use constructor injection
- [ ] Refactor SubmissionService to use constructor injection
- [ ] Refactor TransformationService to use constructor injection
- [ ] Refactor TwitterService to use constructor injection
- [ ] Implement service factory pattern
- [ ] Update service initialization in app.ts

### Phase 4: Route Layer
- [ ] Create modular route structure
- [ ] Implement submission.routes.ts
- [ ] Implement feed.routes.ts
- [ ] Implement config.routes.ts
- [ ] Implement plugin.routes.ts
- [ ] Implement leaderboard.routes.ts
- [ ] Implement stats.routes.ts
- [ ] Implement trigger.routes.ts
- [ ] Implement test.routes.ts
- [ ] Add request validation with Zod schemas
- [ ] Standardize response formatting
- [ ] Set up centralized error handling middleware

### Phase 5: Application Bootstrap
- [ ] Refactor app.ts to use the new patterns
- [ ] Implement proper service initialization
- [ ] Configure middleware consistently
- [ ] Set up graceful shutdown
- [ ] Update static route handling

### Phase 6: Plugin System Enhancement
- [ ] Improve plugin system for better modularity
- [ ] Enhance plugin type safety
- [ ] Standardize plugin initialization and configuration
- [ ] Prepare for potential extraction as a separate package

### Phase 7: Testing & Documentation
- [ ] Update unit tests for refactored components
- [ ] Update integration tests for database operations
- [ ] Update component tests for critical flows
- [ ] Update end-to-end tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Create mock implementations for external dependencies
- [ ] Update documentation to reflect the new architecture
- [ ] Create examples for implementing new components

## Completed Tasks

### Analysis & Planning
- [x] Analyze current codebase structure and patterns
- [x] Identify areas for improvement in the backend architecture
- [x] Create a comprehensive refactoring plan with detailed steps
- [x] Update Memory Bank documentation to reflect the new architecture

## Current Work

- Implementing the refactoring plan, starting with Phase 1: Core Infrastructure & Type System
- Setting up the foundation for the new architecture
- Preparing for the transition from the current architecture to the new one

## Upcoming Work

- Complete Phase 1 and move on to Phase 2
- Begin refactoring repositories to use the new base repository pattern
- Start implementing the dependency injection container
- Create the first modular route files

## Known Issues

- Need to ensure backward compatibility during refactoring
- Need to handle the transition from singleton patterns to dependency injection
- Need to maintain plugin system functionality during refactoring
- Need to ensure all existing API endpoints continue to function with the new route organization
