## Current Focus: Backend Refactoring

We are currently focused on a comprehensive refactoring of the backend architecture to improve maintainability, modularity, and testability. This refactoring aims to standardize patterns, reduce redundancy, and create a more organized codebase.

### Key Refactoring Areas

1. **Type System Refactoring**
   - Creating a single source of truth for types derived from the database schema
   - Using drizzle-zod to generate Zod schemas from Drizzle tables
   - Deriving TypeScript types from these Zod schemas
   - Ensuring consistent type usage across the application

2. **Repository Layer Enhancement**
   - Implementing a base repository class with common CRUD operations
   - Refactoring existing repositories to extend this base class
   - Standardizing error handling in repositories
   - Adding missing repository methods for complete data access

3. **Service Layer Standardization**
   - Implementing a service factory pattern for dependency injection
   - Refactoring services to use consistent initialization patterns
   - Standardizing error handling in services
   - Ensuring proper separation of concerns

4. **Route Layer Modularization**
   - Implementing a modular route structure with dedicated files per resource
   - Adding request validation using Zod schemas
   - Standardizing response formatting
   - Improving error handling in route handlers

5. **Application Bootstrap Refactoring**
   - Refactoring app.ts to use the new patterns
   - Implementing proper service initialization
   - Setting up centralized error handling
   - Configuring middleware consistently

6. **Plugin System Enhancement**
   - Improving the plugin system for better modularity
   - Preparing for potential extraction as a separate package
   - Enhancing plugin type safety
   - Standardizing plugin initialization and configuration

### Recent Changes

- Completed analysis of current codebase structure and patterns
- Identified areas for improvement in the backend architecture
- Created a comprehensive refactoring plan with detailed steps
- Updated Memory Bank documentation to reflect the new architecture

### Current Challenges

- Ensuring backward compatibility during refactoring
- Maintaining type safety throughout the application
- Balancing between standardization and flexibility
- Managing the transition from singleton patterns to dependency injection
- Handling the plugin system's integration with Hono routes

### Next Steps

#### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure & Type System
1. Create `backend/src/core/types.ts` for centralized type definitions
2. Implement `backend/src/core/errors.ts` for custom error classes
3. Set up dependency injection container in `backend/src/core/container.ts`
4. Define application context in `backend/src/core/appContext.ts`

#### Phase 2: Data Access Layer
1. Create `backend/src/services/db/repositories/base.repository.ts`
2. Refactor existing repositories to extend BaseRepository
3. Standardize error handling in repositories
4. Move query logic from queries.ts into respective repositories

#### Phase 3: Service Layer
1. Define standard service interfaces
2. Refactor services to use constructor injection
3. Update service initialization in app.ts
4. Implement service factory pattern

#### Phase 4: Route Layer
1. Create modular route files for each resource
2. Implement request validation with Zod schemas
3. Standardize response formatting
4. Set up centralized error handling middleware

#### Phase 5: Application Bootstrap
1. Refactor app.ts to use the new patterns
2. Implement proper service initialization
3. Configure middleware consistently
4. Set up graceful shutdown

### Integration Points

- **Database Connection**: Ensure the refactored repositories work with the existing connection management
- **Plugin System**: Maintain compatibility with the current plugin system while improving its structure
- **API Routes**: Ensure all existing API endpoints continue to function with the new route organization
- **Error Handling**: Integrate the new error handling system with existing logging and reporting
- **Configuration**: Maintain compatibility with the current configuration system

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for individual components (repositories, services)
- Integration tests for database operations
- Component tests for critical flows
- End-to-end tests for API endpoints
- Mock implementations for external dependencies

### Documentation Updates

- Update Memory Bank files to reflect the new architecture
- Document the new patterns and conventions
- Create examples for implementing new components
- Update .clinerules with new coding standards
