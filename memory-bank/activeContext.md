# Active Context

## Current Focus
Platform Stability and Feature Enhancement

### Background
- Successfully operating with Node.js/Hono backend
- Maintaining Bun for package management and development
- Plugin system fully operational with multiple distributors and transformers
- Multiple active feeds with Twitter-based curation

### Next Phase
1. **Platform Stability**
   - Monitoring system performance
   - Ensuring reliable content processing
   - Maintaining plugin compatibility
   - Optimizing resource usage

2. **Feature Enhancement**
   - Expanding distributor plugins
   - Improving transformation capabilities
   - Enhancing curator experience
   - Developing recap functionality

3. **Documentation Maintenance**
   - Keeping API documentation current
   - Updating plugin development guides
   - Maintaining deployment documentation
   - Documenting configuration options

### Key Considerations
- Ensuring reliable content processing
- Supporting growing number of feeds
- Maintaining plugin compatibility
- Balancing performance and features
- **JSON sanitization throughout transformation pipeline**

## Active Decisions

### Architecture
1. Node.js/Hono in production
   - Stable and reliable
   - Good performance characteristics
   - Native module compatibility
2. Bun for development
   - Fast package management
   - Excellent developer experience
   - Strong workspace support
3. **Improved Backend Organization**
   - Modular route structure
   - Dedicated utility for secure file serving
   - Path traversal protection
   - Proper MIME type handling

### Plugin System
- Runtime module federation for plugins
- Type-safe plugin configuration
- Hot-reloading support
- Standardized interfaces for different plugin types

### Content Flow
- Twitter as primary content source
- Trusted curator moderation
- Configurable transformation pipeline
- Multi-channel distribution

## Current Focus Areas
1. System reliability and performance
2. Plugin ecosystem expansion
3. Curator experience improvement
4. Documentation maintenance
5. **Testing infrastructure overhaul**

## Next Steps
1. Enhance recap functionality
2. Expand distributor options
3. Improve transformation capabilities
4. Optimize resource usage
5. **Implement comprehensive testing strategy**

## Validated Solutions
1. Twitter-based submission and moderation
2. Plugin-based architecture
3. Configuration-driven feed management
4. Multi-channel content distribution
5. **Secure static file serving with proper MIME types**
6. **JSON sanitization at key points in the transformation pipeline**

## Testing Strategy Overhaul

### Current Testing Issues
- Over-reliance on mocks instead of component-level testing
- Using fake databases instead of real ones in Docker containers
- Inconsistent test data management
- Limited HTTP integration testing
- Insufficient message queue testing
- Hidden mocks that make tests harder to understand

### Testing Approach Decision
- **Complete refactoring required** - The existing testing approach needs to be overhauled, not adapted
- Focus on component tests as primary testing strategy
- Use Docker-Compose for real database and infrastructure
- Implement a fake MQ for message queue testing
- Create a clear directory structure for different test types
- Follow Node.js testing best practices as documented in memory-bank/testingPlan.md

### Implementation Priority
1. Set up Docker-Compose for testing infrastructure
2. Create a fake MQ implementation
3. Refactor existing tests to use real database
4. Add component tests for key flows
5. Add integration tests for external services
6. Add E2E tests for full flows
